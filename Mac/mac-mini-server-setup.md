# Mac mini server setup

Best Mac ever for home server, though still too bad for this kind of usage. However I do need a cheap Mac to migrate my personal MBP in near future, if it could serve some services better than my current N100 system that's a bonus.

## Settings
- Energy Saver: speaks for itself
- Lock screen: Disable screen saver, turn off display
- Sharing: enable VNC
